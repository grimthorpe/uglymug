Welcome to the 21st Century!

UglyMUG should now be built using CMake.

Dependencies:
	At the moment the CMake recipe is hard-coded to use libcrypt, libpcre, libncurses.

	The headers & libraries for these packages should be pre-installed
	on your machine before you try building things.

	One day I might get around to checking for them.

Build process:

In the root directory run:

cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make

After the first cmake run you shouldn't have to run it again, unless you are making
major changes to the build system.

The game driver is output to $/build/game/netmud
