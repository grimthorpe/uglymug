How to compile UglyMUG
======================

0. Prepare your preferred beverage.  Call it $beverage.

1. Ensure you are using gmake.  Our Makefile probably won't work with
   any other flavour of make.

2. Check whether we support your build environment.  Run:
     make checkenvironment
   and see what it thinks your environment is.  If your environment is
   unsupported, read the PORTING file.  If your environment is supported,
   this will tell you a platform type.  Call this $platform.

3. If you don't want make to spew a load of errors the first time you make it,
   ensure the builds/$platform directory exists.

4. Run:
     make
   or:
     make all

5. Drink $beverage, while watching the screen warily for errors.

6. Your compiled output should be builds/$platform/netmud, possibly with a
   suffix such as netmud.exe if your platform requires this.
