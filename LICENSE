See copyright.h for full details.

We have tried getting permission from all the relevant parties in the past
to convert the project to GPL(v2) but failed to track everyone down.

With the numerous changes of source control over the years we no longer
remember who wrote what.

In general it is similar to the MIT license but with a request from the
original developers that code changes should get back to them somehow if
possible.
