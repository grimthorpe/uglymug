This is the code for 'Egor', the python-based robot for UglyMUG.

The code relies on several standard modules, which will be documented here as 
I work it out.

It also uses the Yahoo! python API, and the Google Search API.

NOTE: The Googl Search API has been deprecated by Google. No further access
keys are being generated as far as I know, so in order to use the code
you may need to disable that functionality.
