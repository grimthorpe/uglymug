$Name:  $

Tag file. Lists the tags and the broad changes made.
Please update everytime a new release goes live on
the main game. This way we can always pull out the
correct version. In reverse order.
Leave the Name: tag at the top of the file to get
the correct release tag embedded in the game when you
build it.

um1_019 - Grimthorpe
    Collection of updates:
    Stop the game crashing if we get an almost-empty string after expanding
    variables.
    Stop the game making noise with @channel if run from a Silent softcode
    command.
    Fix 'scat' so that it works on SysV derived UNIX platforms.

um1_018 - Grimthorpe
    More egg on face. string_match had a NULL string check the wrong
    way around.

um1_017 = Grimthorpe
    Egg on face time. @<softcodecommand> didn't work due to the fix.

um1_016 - Grimthorpe
    More string stuff, this time finishing off the stringutil.c stuff.
    Also, |foo should now check #4 for 'foo', as it used to.

um1_015 - Grimthorpe
    A huge change.
    The next part of the 'convert everything to String/CString'.

um1_014 - Grimthorpe
    The perils of extreme programming. If you find a bug in one piece of code,
    check to see if there are any others nearby. @channel leave was the problem.
    Also someone found a 'new' bug! NULL pointers being used again...

um1_013 - Grimthorpe
    Nasty bug in the chat code; instead of iterating over the list with x-next()
    I used x++ instead...
    Also, the version string gets dumped to stderr rather than stdout so that
    we know where the logs came from.

um1_012 - Grimthorpe
    Second attempt at fixing '@endif' locking problem. We weren't flushing
    the parser cache.

um1_011 - Grimthorpe
    @channel / chat cleaned up and 'fixed'.
    You can also set a channel as censored.
    '[xxx has connected]' now comes out in colour, is better written,
    and generally better.
    First attempt at fixing '@endif' locking problem.

um1_010 - Grimthorpe
    Not really a major change, but now we have the release tag in the code
    done properly, as long as everyone remebers to edit the top line of this
    file. I suppose I could automate it with a Name CVS tag...

um1_009 - Grimthorpe
    Private channels: Wizards can override private channel settings, in case
    of error. Please do not abuse it.
    DONTANNOUNCE: A new flag (DontAnnounce) to stop the [xxx has connected]
    announcements
    Julian's updates: Julian has tidied up the code (again) to make it more
    cross-platform.

um1_008 - Grimthorpe
    Bug fix 1 for String code: Array_storage::insert_element was totally
    bogus. This is now fixed(tm)

um1_007 - Grimthorpe
    Awooga Awooga Awooga. Red Alert, Shields Up.
    Be prepared for almost immediate roll-back to release um1_006 on live
    systems, while furtive hackers try to fix the bugs found.
    Yes, the first part of the string-replacement code is going in.
    Be afraid. Very afraid.

um1_006 - Grimthorpe
    At last, a way of identifying which tag was used to get the source out.

um1_005 - Grimthorpe
    A few more null pointer fixes.
    Note: These should all go away when the major code update goes in.
    But we're waiting on Keith's HALFQUIT (and related) stuff before that
    can go in.

um1_004 - Grimthorpe
    Yet more null pointer fixes. One day we'll fix them all, or replace
    either vsprintf or the use of char* for strings.

um1_003 - Grimthorpe
    Not sure of the changes. If you could fill
    some in Grim...
    Well, lets start with NULL pointer protection, followed by a liberal
    sprinkling of value_or_empty, add a little NULL pointer protection
    and heat for a few hours before topping off with a stupid strdup/free
    (real bug) fix.

release_002 - Reaps
    Set the UNCONNECTED idle limit to 5 mins

release_001 - Reaps
    Removed all the words from the idle and connect
	times except for Muddict which happens
	between 8 and 9 hours connect.
    Made all times cope with weeks of connect/idle
	including the idle message from pages.
