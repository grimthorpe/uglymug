Tag file. Lists the tags and the broad changes made.
Please update everytime a new release goes live on
the main game. This way we can always pull out the
correct version. In reverse order.

um1_008 - Grimthorpe
    Bug fix 1 for String code: Array_storage::insert_element was totally
    bogus. This is now fixed(tm)

um1_007 - Grimthorpe
    Awooga Awooga Awooga. Red Alert, Shields Up.
    Be prepared for almost immediate roll-back to release um1_006 on live
    systems, while furtive hackers try to fix the bugs found.
    Yes, the first part of the string-replacement code is going in.
    Be afraid. Very afraid.

um1_006 - Grimthorpe
    At last, a way of identifying which tag was used to get the source out.

um1_005 - Grimthorpe
    A few more null pointer fixes.
    Note: These should all go away when the major code update goes in.
    But we're waiting on Keith's HALFQUIT (and related) stuff before that
    can go in.

um1_004 - Grimthorpe
    Yet more null pointer fixes. One day we'll fix them all, or replace
    either vsprintf or the use of char* for strings.

um1_003 - Grimthorpe
    Not sure of the changes. If you could fill
    some in Grim...
    Well, lets start with NULL pointer protection, followed by a liberal
    sprinkling of value_or_empty, add a little NULL pointer protection
    and heat for a few hours before topping off with a stupid strdup/free
    (real bug) fix.

release_002 - Reaps
    Set the UNCONNECTED idle limit to 5 mins

release_001 - Reaps
    Removed all the words from the idle and connect
	times except for Muddict which happens
	between 8 and 9 hours connect.
    Made all times cope with weeks of connect/idle
	including the idle message from pages.
