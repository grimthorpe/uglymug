@rem um1_042 - I thought Grimthorpe had retired...
ums topic = UM Version
ums add = um1_042 - I thought Grimthorpe had retired... = Coloured Retired players bright-blue.\
Re-implemented the player-list, so name lookups should be faster now.\
Got rid of the free object list, as it is easier to just search for the first free object.\
Added @channel list = #channelname\
Added the 'Retired' flag. It hides the Wizard/Apprentice flags in unparse_object and 'who'.\
Modified 'who' so that it displays the 'X' flag for Wizards & Apprentices that are set XBuilder (compare to Welcomer flag). It never shows for GOD, but if required can be changed easily.\
Fixed @boot so that if the target doesn't exist we don't crash the game.\
Changed get code (do_get) so you can't get things from other players (aka theft).\
Changed drop code (do_drop) so you can only drop things that you are carrying.\
  This prevents "drop here:object" and "drop <player>:object" which are just silly.\
Changed teleport code (do_at_location) to let players teleport their puppets and NPCs\
Changed idle-message from "...who has been inactive for 3 minutes." to "...who has been inactive for 3 minutes:". It's just slightly nicer.\
Modified @?hardcodecommands to use String concatenation.\
Implemented @?my name, to return the name that the current command was called as.\
Commands locked against a player no longer stop the search for a useable command.\
Changed @for so that if the step is 'the wrong way' we ignore it silently (so that @for i=1 to 0 step 1 will do nothing, rather than bug out)\
Fixed @with so that it doesn't run the contents of the loop if the array or dictionary is empty.\
Re-added the 'help' hardcode command to make the game engine consistant.\
.leave can no longer go infinitely-recursive any more.


@rem um1_043 - For a retired person he's working too much.
ums topic = UM Version
ums add = um1_043 - For a retired person he's working too much. = Fixed the player name cache so that it removes players when they are destroyed.\
Added a command cache on each object that should improve the speed of things.\
Fixed up 'who' and 'swho' to use the right colours.\
Produce a HACK log when a retired wizard connects.
