                  XML parser for Gnome

Documentation is available on-line at
    http://rufus.w3.org/veillard/XML/xml.html

A mailing-list has been set-up, to subscribe:
    echo "subscribe xml" | mail majordomo@rufus.w3.org

The list archive is at:
    http://rufus.w3.org/veillard/XML/messages/

NOTE: I use a second CVS server for experimental version of the XML code,
      this mean that if you commit without a Changelog or without sending
      the patch to me or the list, it may well get lost. I usually check
      before copying over the Gnome directory, but it may happen.

    People interested in the bleeding edge or what I'm up to can check
    at http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/XML/
