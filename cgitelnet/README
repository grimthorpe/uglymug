NOTE this program is entirely based on the CVS code in:
http://cgitelnet.sourceforge.net/

I have attempted to contact the author, but had no response.

I needed this program for the local project, and wanted to modify it.
I believe that the changes I have made (at time of writing) are 
significant and worthwhile, and almost without exception useful outside
the local context.

Below is the original readme, I will include all further details
in README.UglyCODE

NOTE:
     THIS PROGRAM IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. AS SUCH, IT IS UNSTABLE AND
     IT HAS MANY BUGS. DON'T EVEN THINK TO USE IT IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.

     If you want it completed, visit http://cgitelnet.sourceforge.net/
     to find out how.
